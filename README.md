\# âš¡ EV Range Predictor



A \*\*Machine Learningâ€“based web application\*\* that predicts the driving range of an Electric Vehicle (EV) based on its specifications.  

Built using \*\*Python\*\*, \*\*Scikit-Learn\*\*, and \*\*Streamlit\*\*.

\## ðŸš€ Overview

Electric vehicles have varying ranges depending on parameters such as battery capacity, load, power consumption, and weight.  

This project uses a regression model to predict the estimated range (in kilometers) for a given EV configuration.
